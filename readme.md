This project is a simple analysis of a company's sales data to discover some actionable insights for their internal team. The main goal of this project was to explore collabroative work on Github as well as connect to a dashboard and share insights using a visualisation platform such as PowerBI or Tableau

The database was created in a local repository in MySQL using SQL and the data then trasnformed into csv files using SQL. Since this is a collaborative project, my role in the project was to simply create and share the datasets in the database.
